# MSc thesis
The content in this repository is still work in progress. I am currently working
towards my deadline in November.

## What
The thesis focus on time series classification with uni-dimensional CNNs, in
which the research question is concerned in answering how this compares to
LSTM-based RNNs.

## Why
LSTM have complex gating mechanisms, requiring extensive computational
resources. Architectures like GRU have been proposed as an alternative, although
in recent years, CNNs have proven to be potential competitors to these
these architectures. The thesis aims to understand how and why, through extensive
experiments across three use cases and datasets

## How
* Codebase: ~2000 lines of Python-code
* Most important libraries used: **Keras** and **Pandas**
